As a software engineer, I spend most of my time building out robust backend systems. I get a kick out of creating scalable, high-performance applications that power cool digital products.

I also enjoy weaving in AI to make the backend services I create smarter and more data-driven. To keep everything running smoothly and reliably, I'm a big believer in using modern DevOps practices, like setting up automated CI/CD pipelines. Tying backend development, AI, and DevOps together is how I approach building complete and powerful software.

I love tackling tricky problems and I'm always on the lookout for new technologies that can help me build better things.
